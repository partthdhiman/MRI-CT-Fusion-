# MRI–CT Fusion (CHAOS) — UNet GAN + Refinement

**Project**: MRI–CT Fusion with Generative AI (CHAOS dataset)  
**Authors**: Partth Dhiman & Dhruv Paliwal  
**License**: MIT

## Overview
This repository contains code to train a UNet-based generator + PatchGAN discriminator and a small refinement network to fuse MRI and CT abdominal scans into a single, clinically useful image. The system was developed and tested on the CHAOS combined CT/MR dataset (paired images). The repository includes training, inference, evaluation, and plotting scripts to reproduce results and generate figures for reports/presentations.
